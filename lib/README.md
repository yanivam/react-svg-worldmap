## Documentation & Examples

We use GitHub pages to provide documentation with ample of live examples.

Give it a try at [yanivam.github.io/react-svg-worldmap](https://yanivam.github.io/react-svg-worldmap).

## Why is it different?

Focus on simple and free.

- Draw countries on a world map.
- Free - Really free with no limits.
- No registration - It is just a pure react component.
- No internet dependency - All the data is local, no calls to a back-end server.
- Easy to learn, easy to use, easy to customize.

## Yet another package for world map...but why?

It all started with a fun project that I was building and needed to draw simple yet beautiful world's map. Searching for solutions I found many potential solutions like MapBox and Google Maps, but they were "too smart" for what I needed. They needed to "call home" for the data, they supported tons of options I didn't need, and while they included react-integrations, they were not completely native to the react world. There was definitely something missing. And that's when react-svg-worldmap started.

## Where are we getting the data for the world map?

We have sourced our data from Natural Earth, a community-driven initiative aimed at creating visually appealing and high-quality maps using cartography or GIS software for small-scale projects. Our use of open source tools in creating this map data is not intended to express any political views, but rather to fulfill the requirements of this project.
